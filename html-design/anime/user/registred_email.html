Your username is {{ username }}
Your auto-generated password is {{ password }}
It is your choice to use username or e-mail for login, but I prefer to
use username because it is shorter. After all you username consist of
{% if openid %}bunch of letters and numbers{% else %}your e-mail and some hash{% endif %} and it simple to remember.
Ou, about your password. It is a word. Nice simple word, so simple that it
took me 2 ns to remember it. #{".$]4'&_ instead of word? Well, you are
unlucky today. Save it however, should you forget it, blame yourself.
You can always <a href="http://anicat.net{% url password_change %}">change</a> or <a href="http://anicat.net{% url password_reset %}">reset</a> it by the way.

Also, you can change your user name if you want. Use your <a href="http://anicat.net{% url settings %}">settings</a> page.
